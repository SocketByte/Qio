# Qio
Super simple interpreted language written in Java. It uses simple split parsers so it does not contain any advanced lexers.
It was based on Java and assembly/bytecode. It is basically an advanced command system.

# Code
It is awful. I know. A lot of unnecessary complications and generics. I would clean that shit up but I don't have time currently.
The worst classes are definitely `QioInterpreter` and `TypeDetector`. These are really not designed well. 
... but it works, and it works pretty fast actually!

# How to open it?
Download the editor and lang (built-in) from the **Releases** page
and run it using
```
java -jar Qio-v2.8.jar
pause
```
# Bugs?
Yes. They're the only thing that work properly in this language - mystical bugs.
The biggest one yet is that you can not put more loop call than **one** because the language will throw nulls and errors everywhere.
Yeah... that's embarassing. 

# License
Basically **do what the fuck you want** license. It is so bad that I won't be mad if you use it.
You don't even need to credit me... you know what, you **CAN'T** credit me, that's not me, that's not my code, it's too bad XD
